## Why you need TV Dashboards

1. to Show main company indicators in one place
```
You likely recieve a lot of reports and emails, use different services for getting different measures. 
Something important sometimes pass you by. So it would be a dream to have at least the main indicators on hand.

But what are they - the main indicators? It's the first and very important question you are to answer before getting started.
Сarry out a survey and try to extract all usefull information.
```

2. to Form transparency & data-driven culture
```
Transparency means that employees feel the trust, know the company shares the joys and challenges. 
It's important. But don't forget about confidentiality.
Something company wants to keep inside or some information can be misinterpreted.
```

3. to Motivate your employees
```
One possible way is to create separate google slides for each Head of Department 
and to allow her/him to share the best results of the Department. 
Other colleagues really feel proud of the best staff of the month.
```

## Main rules of building TV Dashboard

1. Simplicity & clarity
```
My practice shows that too few persons would stay and stare on multiple charts on 1 slide.
It's better to place just 1 or 2 measures per slide and rotate multiple ones on slightly higher speed.
```

2. Logical grouping and consistency
```

```

3. Nice design

## 3. Rotating Dashboards in Tableau
* Create separate dashboards (possible in different workbooks)
  - for TV with 1080р use resolution 1700х960 or experiment
* Create a web-page with a list of dashboards & display timing (you can post it anywhere, e.g. on github pages or your web-site)  
  - also you can add google slides in a special format
  - **see an example [here](https://github.com/AdamovichAleksey/KufarTV/blob/master/index.html)**
* Create 1 dashboard with 1 “web-page” sheet
  - for TV with 1080р use resolution 1728х980
